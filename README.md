# Standalone Exercises
This is a collection of small exercises and examples for use in the classroom or as homework. All are small enough to be completed in a single day. The exercise are presented in no particular order.

## The Exercises
- [hours in a year](hours-in-a-year.md), adapted from Chris Pine's _Learn to Program_.
- [calculator](calculator.md)
- [significant women in computing history](women-in-computing.md)
- [random menu generator](random-menu-generator.md), shamelessly stolen from Kari.
- [fancify your baby dragon](fancify-baby-dragon.md)
- [match the mockup](html-mockup.md)
