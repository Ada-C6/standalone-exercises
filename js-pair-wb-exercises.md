# Getting to Know JavaScript: Whiteboard Pair Exercises
For each exercise, choose one person to whiteboard a potential solution. Then, the person who whiteboarded the problem is the _navigator_ in a pair programming exercise to implement the solution described.

For then second problem, reverse roles. The person who listened (and was the _pilot_) will whiteboard the solution and act as _navigatior_ when implementing.

## 1. Reverse an Array
JavaScript provides an `Array.reverse` function. For practice, we're going to write something similar. Neither solution should use the reverse function. Write a function called `reverseArray()` that takes an array, `ar`, as an argument and returns a __new array__ that has the same elements as `ar`, but in reverse order.

### Bonus fun!
Write a function called `reverseArrayInPlace()` that takes an array `ar` as an argument and returns the same array modified to have its elements in reverse order.

## 2. Palindrome
Build a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns whether or not that string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if, when reversed, it reads the same. Example: "tacocat".

### Bonus fun!
Modify the palindrome function to optionally (default `true`) include spaces when determining if the provided string is a palindrome.
