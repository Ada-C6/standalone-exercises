# Object Oriented Design Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice designing objects and the way they would interact. The goal is _not_ to write the code to complete the exercise, though you're welcome to if you would like.

## Problem Statement
We need to design a system that would allow us to utilize a deck of cards in a game. This deck of cards should not have behavior specific to any particular game.

The user of a deck of cards should be able to shuffle the cards as well as deal cards. Dealing should work for a specified number of players as well as a specified number of cards.

## Design
Questions:
- How does a card relate to a deck?
- What properties does a card have?

## Complete
- Determine which classes you would create
  - For each class, define the attributes and methods you would utilize
  - Method definitions should include any parameters you would be using
